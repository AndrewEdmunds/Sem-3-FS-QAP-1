Path:

As stated in the QAP, 'path' is one of the Node.js core, so there is no need to install any packages
to use it. the path module gives you access to the path object which can be used to do some cool things 
related to file paths and directories. This includes mostly simple methods such as 'dirname' which will
return the directory name of a path, or 'extname' which returns the file extention of a path, such as '.js'
or '.java'.

OS:

OS is also part of the Node.js core, the OS module unsurprisingly relates to the operating system. Some things
you can do with OS is use methods such as 'arch' which will return the system architecture such as 'x64'. Another
method you can use is 'hostname' which will return the hostname of the operating system. Of course just as
with 'path', there are many more methods available to use.

HTTP:

'HTTP' just as 'OS' and 'Path' is part of Node.js core. The 'HTTP' module is used to create HTTP servers,
make HTTP requests, handle requests, and interact with HTTP protocol. This makes 'HTTP' quite an important
module. Two methods you could use are 'createServer' which is very self explainatory, and 'request'
 which basically makes a client request to a specific URL.
